					Alongside the product search and the product listing, the product show page is one of the most important pages on a website. It gives the final reassurance to the customer that they would like to buy the product. What exactly makes a good product detail page? 
				%p
					It's best not to pay too much attention to current trends as every website, every company and every product is different. You may want a copy of a website you like, however their users could be completely different to yours. The way in which they shop for products on that site will differ to the way you shop for products on yours.

					But that being said it's useful to look at current trends to get a feel of what a modern e-commerce website looks like. One change in trend is it the top of your a product detail page. The product image the title some detail and add to basket was once in a 3 column grid, with an image on the left, product details including name in the middle, and a quantity and add to basket on the right. But now we mostly see two column grids with a larger image on the left add to basket quantity and some minimal product detail on the right. The larger image is mostly due to the rise of clothing shops online, retail space more known for the high Street. If you're buying a pair of shoes you're mostly going to care what they look like, and whether or not they are comfortable. Since you can't try them on on a website it's best to make the image as big as possible, removing the need to instantly zoom on the image. Cutting down the amount of product detail on the right hand side isn't a problem, as website users will want to read as little as possible. Another benefit to a 2 column grid, it's much cleaner and easier to do it digest. You can make make-up the important information such as the product name, the price and the add to basket button much bigger.

					Another asset to the product detail page that has recently entered the arena is the sticky quantity and add to basket. Pages are now getting longer and longer as e-commerce sites add more and more content around a product. Once a customer's looked through all of these details. Including the all-important reviews which could take some scrolling to make sure of the products quality and accuracy of the description. The add to basket and quantity can seem a long way away, this is vital that you get an action before you lose the sale. With a sticky add to basket it's always on the screen.

					The sticky add to basket can be be the add to basket from the right hand side which then just follows you down the page. But then you must leave a column at the right hand side for the vast majority of the page. Or as the user scrolls down you have an add to basket slide down from the top of the screen. Which means you have the whole page to layout content. The only downside to this is that some users won't notice it. The add to basket on the right hand side has always been there.

					There is a theory that the colour of an add to basket button could increase the likelihood other user buying a product. Now this does seem a bit far-fetched to believe that the the buying decision can be swayed by the colour of a button when the obvious price or look of the product and more certainly the reviews would be the deciding factor. If the colour of the button was green a user is more likely to click it as an action. Of course it's best to test this yourself and analyse the results, but the fact that none of the top websites such as Amazon have a green button suggests that this may not be the case.

					Another decision you are faced with is what to do with your general product details, product specification and your reviews. You have three options here. Simply show it all and stack them on top of each other. This is handy as the user doesn't have to click on anything, simply scroll. But the page will be very long and a user may get bored scrolling. Second option is to list these on top of each other however collapse one or two to items in a concertina. A user will see the vital information and if they would like to read more can simply click on on the title to show more content. The only downside is to see any of your marketing content that has been carefully written to increase the likelihood of a sale you are relying on the user to click the button. The final option is to use tabs. This reduces the amount of scrolling and the user is never too far away from the content. However, this can and prove difficult to display on a mobile device. If the tabs are wider than the width of a phone, you can't exactly expect a user to scroll sideways.

					You may so have the complexity of adding to basket for delivery or for a collection. Do you have one add to basket button, then ask the user to choose between delivery or collection? Or do you have a deliver and a collection button. Generally the first option is the simplest for the user. And the simplest for you you as at that point you may not know whether you have the item in stock for collection or in stock for delivery. You could argue that it doesn't make any difference whether it is a collection or a delivery. But it does if it's out of stock for either of the options. You can always display your delivery stock, but you can't display the collection stock until you know which store the customer would like to collect from. A step between the product detail page and the basket page is required, if a customer adds items to their basket they will then expect to checkout as soon as they hit that page. It's not good to break the hearts of your customers by letting them know at that point that the item is out of stock.

					Some websites will also have a pop-up when you add to basket to prompt you to check out, or indeed upsell the customer related products. This will work if your average order only contains one product. It makes it nice and convenient for a user to checkout without the need to even glance up to see the basket. If your average orders are three or more items, this then becomes a dreaded intrusive pop-up. You might also see a notification pop-up from the bottom of the screen, maybe even the basket sliding out from the side, and possibly users will be taken straight to the basket page. The add to basket button changing colour or text is probably the simplest and most subtle way of notifying the user their item should be in the basket.

					Another variable to look at is the average quantity added for a product. If this is low you could have a drop down quantity selector. If higher than 10 you need an input box, possibly including plus and minus arrows.

					Upselling could be the key to the success of a product detail page. It's easy to include too many other products for the customers consideration. Similar products, also bought, accessories, products of the same brand, recently viewed the list is endless. Frequently bought together is probably the most useful information to a customer. Similar products if the item is an item you would browse for, t-shirts, watches etc. If the item is from a top brand backed up by advertising, other products in that brand is a must. If there are no similar products, then you always have recently viewed to fall back on. But it's best not to have 10 rows of 50 items, as the user will lose interest.
